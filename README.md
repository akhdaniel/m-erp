## Pitch

M-ERP is a highly extensible microservices-based ERP system that helps businesses and developers build customizable enterprise solutions by providing standardized APIs and modular business components, similar to Odoo but with modern microservices architecture.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Medium to Large Businesses**: Organizations needing customizable ERP solutions that can scale with their growth
- **Software Development Teams**: Developers building business applications who need robust ERP foundations
- **Enterprise IT Departments**: Organizations requiring multi-technology ERP stacks with flexible integration capabilities
- **System Integrators**: Companies specializing in custom ERP implementations and extensions

### User Personas

**Business Operations Manager** (35-50 years old)
- **Role:** Head of Operations
- **Context:** Manages day-to-day business processes across multiple departments
- **Pain Points:** Disconnected systems, manual data entry, lack of real-time visibility
- **Goals:** Streamline operations, improve data accuracy, reduce manual work

**Enterprise Developer** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Senior Software Developer / Technical Lead
- **Context:** Building custom business applications for enterprise clients
- **Pain Points:** Rebuilding common ERP features, complex integration requirements, maintenance overhead
- **Goals:** Accelerate development, ensure scalability, reduce technical debt

**IT Director** (40-55 years old)
- **Role:** Director of Information Technology
- **Context:** Responsible for enterprise technology strategy and implementation
- **Pain Points:** Vendor lock-in, inflexible systems, high customization costs
- **Goals:** Technology flexibility, cost control, future-proof solutions

## The Problem

### Monolithic ERP Limitations

Traditional ERP systems like SAP or Oracle are monolithic, expensive, and difficult to customize. Organizations often pay for features they don't need and struggle to adapt the system to their unique processes. Odoo, in the other hand is much cheaper, but still monolithic and suffers in performance on enterprise level database size.

**Our Solution:** Provide a microservices-based architecture where businesses only deploy and pay for the modules they need.

### Development Complexity

Building custom business applications requires recreating common ERP functionality like user management, permissions, and basic business objects repeatedly.

**Our Solution:** Offer standardized core services and business objects that developers can extend rather than rebuild from scratch.

### Technology Lock-in

Existing ERP solutions force organizations into specific technology stacks, making integration with existing systems difficult and expensive.

**Our Solution:** Enable multi-language service implementation with standardized APIs, allowing each service to use the most appropriate technology.

### Limited Extensibility

Most ERP systems have complex, proprietary extension mechanisms that require specialized knowledge and often break during updates.

**Our Solution:** Provide a standardized plugin/extension system with well-documented APIs that maintain compatibility across updates.
With the help of AI, developers can easily develop and deploy applications or additional features in much faster time and still on maintain a high system reliability.

## Differentiators

### Microservices Architecture

Unlike traditional monolithic ERP systems, we provide true microservices architecture. This results in better scalability, technology flexibility, and the ability to deploy only needed components.

### Standardized API Communication

Unlike custom integration solutions, we provide standardized API communication between all services. This results in easier development, better maintainability, and faster implementation times.

### Multi-Technology Support

Unlike single-language platforms, we support optimal service implementation in different programming languages. This results in better performance, developer productivity, and easier hiring.
