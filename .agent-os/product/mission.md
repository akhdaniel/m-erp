## The Problem

### Monolithic ERP Limitations

Traditional ERP systems like SAP or Oracle are monolithic, expensive, and difficult to customize. Organizations often pay for features they don't need and struggle to adapt the system to their unique processes.

**Our Solution:** Provide a microservices-based architecture where businesses only deploy and pay for the modules they need.

### Development Complexity

Building custom business applications requires recreating common ERP functionality like user management, permissions, and basic business objects repeatedly.

**Our Solution:** Offer standardized core services and business objects that developers can extend rather than rebuild from scratch.

### Technology Lock-in

Existing ERP solutions force organizations into specific technology stacks, making integration with existing systems difficult and expensive.

**Our Solution:** Enable multi-language service implementation with standardized APIs, allowing each service to use the most appropriate technology.

### Limited Extensibility

Most ERP systems have complex, proprietary extension mechanisms that require specialized knowledge and often break during updates.

**Our Solution:** Provide a standardized plugin/extension system with well-documented APIs that maintain compatibility across updates.

## Differentiators

### Microservices Architecture

Unlike traditional monolithic ERP systems, we provide true microservices architecture. This results in better scalability, technology flexibility, and the ability to deploy only needed components.

### Standardized API Communication

Unlike custom integration solutions, we provide standardized API communication between all services. This results in easier development, better maintainability, and faster implementation times.

### Multi-Technology Support

Unlike single-language platforms, we support optimal service implementation in different programming languages. This results in better performance, developer productivity, and easier hiring.
