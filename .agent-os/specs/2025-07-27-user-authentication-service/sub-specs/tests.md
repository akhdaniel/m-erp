This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-27-user-authentication-service/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**User Model**
- Test user creation with valid data
- Test email validation and uniqueness constraints
- Test password hashing and verification
- Test user soft delete functionality
- Test user role assignment and retrieval

**Authentication Service**
- Test JWT token generation with correct claims
- Test JWT token validation and expiration
- Test refresh token creation and validation
- Test password verification logic
- Test session creation and management

**Role & Permission System**
- Test role creation and permission assignment
- Test user permission calculation from roles
- Test role hierarchy and inheritance
- Test permission validation logic

### Integration Tests

**User Registration Flow**
- Test complete registration with email validation
- Test registration with duplicate email rejection
- Test registration with invalid data handling
- Test user activation process

**Authentication Flow**
- Test login with valid credentials returns tokens
- Test login with invalid credentials returns error
- Test token refresh with valid refresh token
- Test token refresh with expired/invalid token
- Test logout invalidates all user sessions

**Admin User Management**
- Test admin can create, read, update, delete users
- Test non-admin cannot access admin endpoints
- Test user role assignment and removal
- Test user account activation/deactivation

**Inter-Service Token Validation**
- Test token verification endpoint returns correct user data
- Test expired token validation returns error
- Test malformed token validation returns error
- Test token with invalid signature returns error

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Authentication Scenario**
- User registers → receives confirmation → logs in → accesses protected resource → logs out
- Admin creates user → assigns roles → user logs in with assigned permissions
- User changes password → old sessions invalidated → must re-authenticate

**Security Scenarios**
- Test password brute force protection (rate limiting)
- Test JWT token tampering detection
- Test session hijacking prevention
- Test unauthorized access attempts logging

**Multi-User Scenarios**
- Multiple users with different roles accessing appropriate resources
- Concurrent login sessions for same user
- Role changes taking effect immediately
- Mass user operations (bulk create/update/delete)

## Mocking Requirements

**External Services**: None required for authentication service (self-contained)

**Time-Based Tests**: Mock `datetime.now()` for consistent token expiration testing

**Password Hashing**: Use test-specific salt for consistent test results

**Database**: Use pytest fixtures with test database setup/teardown

**JWT Tokens**: Mock secret key and expiration times for predictable test tokens

**Rate Limiting**: Mock Redis cache for rate limiting tests (if implemented)

## Performance Tests

**Load Testing**
- Test authentication under concurrent user load
- Test token validation performance with high request volume
- Test database query performance with large user datasets

**Memory Testing**
- Test for memory leaks during long-running authentication sessions
- Test token storage efficiency with many active sessions
