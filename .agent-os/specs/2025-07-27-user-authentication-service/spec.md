# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: User Authentication Service
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a secure, scalable user authentication and authorization microservice that serves as the foundation for the M-ERP system. This service will handle user registration, login, session management, and JWT token generation while providing standardized APIs for all other microservices to verify user identity and permissions.

## User Stories

### Core Authentication Flow

As a user, I want to register and login to the M-ERP system, so that I can access the business management features securely.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User registers with email, password, and basic profile information
2. System validates email uniqueness and password strength
3. User receives email verification (optional for MVP)
4. User logs in with email/password credentials
5. System generates JWT access and refresh tokens
6. User accesses protected resources using JWT tokens
7. System automatically refreshes tokens when they expire
8. User can logout to invalidate all active sessions

### Inter-Service Authentication

As a microservice, I want to verify user identity and permissions, so that I can authorize access to specific resources and operations.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Client sends request with JWT token to any microservice
2. Microservice validates JWT signature and expiration
3. Microservice extracts user ID and permissions from token
4. Microservice grants or denies access based on user authorization level
5. System logs all authentication events for audit purposes

### User Management

As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts and permissions, so that I can control system access and maintain security.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Admin views list of all system users with their status
2. Admin can create, update, deactivate, or delete user accounts
3. Admin assigns roles and permissions to users
4. Admin can reset user passwords and force password changes
5. System tracks all administrative actions for compliance

## Spec Scope

1. **User Registration & Profile Management** - Complete user lifecycle with email validation and profile updates
2. **Secure Authentication** - JWT-based login with bcrypt password hashing and secure session management
3. **Permission System** - Role-based access control with granular permissions for different system areas
4. **Token Management** - Access/refresh token generation, validation, and automatic renewal
5. **User Administration API** - Complete CRUD operations for user management by authorized administrators

## Out of Scope

- Social media login integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Multi-factor authentication (2FA) - reserved for Phase 5
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration - reserved for Phase 5
- Advanced password policies and complexity requirements
- User activity analytics and behavioral tracking

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Authentication API** - Users can register, login, and receive valid JWT tokens
2. **User Management Interface** - Admin dashboard for managing user accounts and permissions
3. **Inter-Service Integration** - Other microservices can validate user tokens and check permissions
