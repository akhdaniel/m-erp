# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Company/Partner Service
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive Company/Partner Service as the second core microservice in the XERPIUM system that provides multi-company operations with proper data isolation and manages all business partner relationships (customers, suppliers, vendors). This service will enable businesses to operate across multiple legal entities while maintaining proper data segregation and handle complex partner relationship management with the existing User Authentication Service.

## User Stories

### Multi-Company Operations Manager

As a business operations manager, I want to manage multiple companies within a single ERP instance, so that I can operate separate legal entities with proper data isolation and financial separation.

**Detailed Workflow:** The manager accesses the admin interface, creates new companies with their legal information, configures data access permissions per company, assigns users to specific companies with appropriate roles, and monitors cross-company operations while ensuring complete data isolation between entities.

### Partner Relationship Coordinator

As a partner relationship coordinator, I want to manage customers, suppliers, and vendors across multiple companies, so that I can maintain comprehensive business relationships with proper categorization and multi-company visibility controls.

**Detailed Workflow:** The coordinator creates partner records with detailed contact information, categorizes partners by type (customer/supplier/vendor), assigns partners to specific companies, manages partner hierarchies for corporate groups, tracks communication history, and configures partner-specific access permissions and pricing agreements.

### System Integration Developer

As a system integration developer, I want standardized APIs for company and partner data, so that I can integrate other microservices and external systems with consistent data access patterns and proper authentication.

**Detailed Workflow:** The developer authenticates via the Auth Service, queries company and partner data through REST APIs, implements proper company-scoped data filtering, handles partner relationship data for business logic, and ensures all operations respect multi-company isolation rules.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Company Management** - Complete company lifecycle with legal entity information, multi-company data isolation, and user-company associations
2. **Partner Management System** - Comprehensive partner (customer/supplier/vendor) management with categorization, contact details, and relationship tracking
3. **Data Isolation Framework** - Robust multi-company data separation with company-scoped queries and access controls
4. **Auth Service Integration** - Seamless integration with existing User Authentication Service for user-company permissions and JWT-based authentication
5. **Partner Relationship Management** - Business partner hierarchies, communication tracking, and cross-company partner visibility controls

## Out of Scope

- Financial transactions and accounting (handled by future Accounting Service)
- Inventory management (handled by future Inventory Service)
- Contract management and legal document handling
- Advanced CRM features like opportunity tracking and sales pipeline management
- International tax compliance and regulatory reporting

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Multi-Company Operations** - Users can create, manage, and switch between companies with complete data isolation
2. **Comprehensive Partner Management** - Full CRUD operations for partners with proper categorization, contact management, and relationship tracking
3. **Working API Integration** - All endpoints properly integrated with Auth Service authentication and return company-scoped data
