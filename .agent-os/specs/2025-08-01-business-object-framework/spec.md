# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Business Object Framework
> Created: 2025-08-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive Business Object Framework that establishes standardized patterns for all business entities in M-ERP, providing base classes, validation frameworks, audit integration, and extension points that ensure consistency across all microservices while supporting multi-company data isolation and event-driven architecture.

## User Stories

### Developer Productivity Enhancement

As a **Developer** building new business modules for M-ERP, I want to inherit from a standardized Business Object Framework, so that I can rapidly implement new entities with automatic audit logging, validation, and CRUD operations without rebuilding common functionality.

The framework should provide base classes that automatically handle common fields (id, created_at, updated_at, company_id), integrate with the existing audit service for change tracking, publish events for all CRUD operations, and provide extension points for custom fields and business logic. This eliminates the need to manually implement these patterns in each new service.

### System Consistency and Maintainability

As a **System Architect**, I want all business objects across all microservices to follow consistent patterns and standards, so that the system maintains architectural coherence and reduces maintenance overhead as new modules are added.

The framework should enforce consistent database schemas, API patterns, validation rules, and event publishing across all services. This ensures that developers can easily understand and work with any business object in the system, and that integration between services follows predictable patterns.

### Enterprise Audit and Compliance

As a **Business Operations Manager**, I want all business object changes to be automatically tracked with full audit trails, so that we can maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and have complete visibility into system changes.

The framework should automatically log all CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE operations with before/after data snapshots, user context, and change timestamps. This should integrate seamlessly with the existing audit service without requiring manual intervention from developers.

## Spec Scope

1. **Base Business Object Classes** - Abstract base classes with common fields, multi-company isolation, and timestamp management
2. **Pydantic Schema Framework** - Standardized validation patterns with Create, Update, and Response schema templates
3. **Automatic Audit Integration** - Seamless integration with existing audit service for all CRUD operations
4. **Event Publishing Integration** - Automatic event publishing for all business object changes using existing messaging system
5. **Extension Points System** - Pluggable architecture for custom fields, validators, and business logic
6. **CRUD Service Patterns** - Standardized service class templates with common operations and error handling
7. **Database Migration Support** - Integration with Alembic for consistent schema management
8. **Type Safety Framework** - Full TypeScript-style type safety using Pydantic and SQLAlchemy type hints

## Out of Scope

- Specific business logic for individual entity types (partners, companies, etc.)
- User interface components or frontend integration
- Database performance optimization or indexing strategies
- Custom field storage implementation (will be addressed in future extension system spec)
- Multi-database or cross-service transaction management

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Framework Implementation** - All business objects can inherit from base classes and automatically get audit logging, event publishing, and validation
2. **Developer Documentation** - Complete examples showing how to create new business objects using the framework
3. **Integration Testing** - All CRUD operations on framework-based objects trigger proper audit logs and events in existing systems
4. **Migration Path** - Existing partner and company services are successfully migrated to use the new framework without breaking changes
