# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-04-enhanced-partner-management/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-04
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Leverage completed Business Object Framework for consistent CRUD operations and audit logging
- Implement all new entities as extensions to existing company-partner-service
- Maintain multi-company data isolation using company_id pattern across all new entities
- Ensure automatic event publishing for all partner-related changes through existing Redis messaging
- Support hierarchical partner relationships with cycle detection and depth limitations
- Implement flexible contact role system with extensible role definitions
- Provide address validation and formatting capabilities with support for international standards
- Support communication tracking with timestamps, user attribution, and categorization
- Maintain referential integrity between partners, contacts, addresses, and categories

## Approach Options

**Option A: Separate Microservice for Enhanced Partner Features**
- Pros: Complete service isolation, independent scaling, dedicated database
- Cons: Increased operational complexity, cross-service data consistency challenges, duplication of partner logic

**Option B: Extend Existing Company-Partner Service with New Entities** (Selected)
- Pros: Leverages existing Business Object Framework, maintains data consistency, single service for all partner operations, utilizes established multi-company patterns
- Cons: Increased service complexity, single service deployment for partner changes

**Rationale:** Option B aligns with the completed Business Object Framework architecture and maintains consistency with the existing partner management implementation. This approach leverages the substantial infrastructure already in place while providing the flexibility needed for enhanced partner features.

## External Dependencies

- **No new external libraries required** - All functionality can be implemented using existing FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic infrastructure
- **Justification:** The Business Object Framework provides all necessary patterns for implementing the new entities, and the existing tech stack supports all required functionality including validation, serialization, and database operations

## Database Schema Requirements

- Create new tables: partner_contacts, partner_addresses, partner_categories, partner_relationships, partner_communications
- Add foreign key relationships to existing partners table
- Implement proper indexing for performance on company_id and partner_id lookups
- Add framework_version column to all new tables for Business Object Framework compatibility
- Ensure all tables follow established naming conventions and include standard audit fields

## Framework Integration

- Utilize BusinessObjectBase and CompanyBusinessObject abstract classes for all new entities
- Implement service classes extending BusinessObjectService for automatic CRUD operations
- Create Pydantic schemas following established validation patterns
- Use controller templates for consistent API endpoint patterns
- Leverage existing audit logging and event publishing infrastructure
- Implement proper multi-company data isolation through company_id filtering
