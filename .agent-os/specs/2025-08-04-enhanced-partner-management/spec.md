# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced Partner Management
> Created: 2025-08-04
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Extend the existing Partner entity with comprehensive relationship management capabilities including multiple contacts per partner, multiple addresses, categorization system, hierarchical relationships, and communication tracking. This feature leverages the completed Business Object Framework for rapid development and consistent patterns while working within the multi-company data isolation system.

## User Stories

### Partner Contact Management

As a Business Operations Manager, I want to manage multiple contacts for each partner with specific roles (primary, billing, technical, sales), so that I can communicate with the right person for different business needs and maintain organized contact information across my organization.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users can add unlimited contacts to any partner, assign roles and responsibilities, set primary contacts for different functions, track contact preferences and communication methods, and maintain a complete history of all interactions with each contact person.

### Partner Address Management

As an Enterprise Developer, I want to configure multiple addresses per partner with specific purposes (billing, shipping, headquarters, branch offices), so that I can handle complex business relationships and ensure accurate document delivery and logistics coordination.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users can define multiple address types per partner, set default addresses for different business functions, validate address formats, handle international address standards, and maintain address change history for compliance and audit purposes.

### Partner Categorization and Relationships

As an IT Director, I want to organize partners into flexible categories and establish hierarchical relationships, so that I can implement business rules, reporting structures, and automated workflows based on partner types and relationships.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users can create custom partner categories, establish parent-child relationships between partners, group related partners for bulk operations, implement category-based access controls, and generate reports based on partner hierarchy and categorization.
