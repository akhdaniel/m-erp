# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Extension System & First Business Module (Phase 3)
> Created: 2025-08-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive plugin/extension framework that enables third-party developers to create and deploy custom modules for XERPIUM, while validating the architecture with a complete purchasing module implementation. This establishes the foundation for XERPIUM's extensible ecosystem and demonstrates enterprise-grade procurement workflows.

## User Stories

### Third-Party Developer Extension Creation

As a **Third-Party Developer** building custom modules for XERPIUM, I want a standardized plugin framework with templates and CLI tools, so that I can rapidly develop and deploy business modules without deep knowledge of the internal architecture.

The framework should provide module templates, dependency management, configuration schemas, API integration patterns, and deployment mechanisms. Developers should be able to create new modules using familiar patterns and have confidence that their modules will integrate seamlessly with core services and other plugins.

### Enterprise Procurement Management

As a **Business Operations Manager**, I want a complete purchasing module that handles supplier management, purchase orders, approvals, and procurement workflows, so that I can streamline our procurement process and maintain proper financial controls.

The purchasing module should support multi-company operations, approval workflows, budget controls, supplier evaluation, and integration with existing partner management. This demonstrates how business modules can leverage the core framework while providing specialized functionality.

### System Administrator Module Management

As a **System Administrator**, I want a centralized module registry and management interface, so that I can discover, install, configure, and monitor business modules across our XERPIUM deployment.

The system should provide module discovery, dependency resolution, installation management, configuration interfaces, health monitoring, and rollback capabilities. Administrators should have full visibility and control over the module ecosystem.

## Spec Scope

1. **Plugin/Extension Framework** - Core architecture for third-party module development and deployment with standardized APIs
2. **Module Registry Service** - Centralized service for module discovery, registration, and lifecycle management
3. **Purchasing Module Implementation** - Complete procurement workflow demonstrating framework capabilities
4. **API Documentation System** - Auto-generated documentation for all services and extension points
5. **Module Template Generator** - CLI tools for rapid module scaffolding and development
6. **Configuration Management System** - Dynamic module configuration with validation and hot-reloading
7. **Module Installation Pipeline** - Automated deployment, testing, and rollback mechanisms

## Out of Scope

- Advanced workflow engine implementation (will be addressed in Phase 4)
- Complex approval hierarchy management beyond basic purchasing workflows
- Financial accounting integration (will be addressed in Phase 5)
- Mobile-specific module interfaces
- Multi-tenant module isolation beyond existing company-level separation
- Real-time collaboration features within modules

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Extension Framework** - Third-party developers can create, package, and deploy custom modules using standardized tools
2. **Functional Purchasing Module** - Complete purchase order to payment workflow operational with approval processes
3. **Module Management Interface** - Administrators can install, configure, and monitor modules through web interface
4. **Developer Documentation** - Complete guides for module development, API integration, and deployment processes
5. **Extension Ecosystem Foundation** - Framework proven capable of supporting complex business modules with real-world requirements
