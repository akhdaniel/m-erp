## User Stories

### Enhanced Contact Management

As a Business Operations Manager, I want to store multiple contacts per partner with detailed information including job titles and departments, so that I can effectively communicate with the right people at each organization.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Add multiple contacts to each partner with names, titles, emails, phones
- Mark primary contact for each partner for default communication
- Track contact departments and add notes for relationship management
- View contact history and communication preferences

### Multiple Address Types

As a Business Operations Manager, I want to manage different address types (billing, shipping, general) for each partner, so that I can properly handle invoicing and delivery logistics.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Add multiple addresses per partner with specific types (billing, shipping, other)
- Set default addresses for different purposes
- Validate address completeness for business processes
- Format addresses for display in documents and forms

### Partner Categorization and Relationships

As a Business Operations Manager, I want to categorize partners and establish hierarchical relationships, so that I can organize my customer and supplier network effectively.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Classify partners as customers, suppliers, vendors, or combinations
