# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-03-enhanced-partner-management/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-03
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Enhanced Partner Model:** Extend existing Partner model with industry classification and improved categorization logic
- **Contact Management:** Implement PartnerContact model with primary contact designation and validation
- **Address Management:** Implement PartnerAddress model with type-based categorization and formatting utilities
- **API Integration:** Extend existing partner service APIs to include contacts and addresses with proper CRUD operations
- **Data Validation:** Implement business rules for contact uniqueness, address completeness, and partner relationship constraints
- **Relationship Management:** Enable proper SQLAlchemy relationships between Partner, PartnerContact, and PartnerAddress models
- **Event Publishing:** Extend existing event system to publish contact and address changes through Redis messaging

## Approach Options

**Option A: Extend Existing Service Architecture**
- Pros: Leverages existing infrastructure, maintains consistency with current codebase, reuses messaging and validation patterns
- Cons: Increases complexity of existing service, potential for larger migration impact

**Option B: Create Separate Contact/Address Microservice** 
- Pros: Service separation, independent scaling, focused responsibility
- Cons: Increases operational complexity, requires cross-service communication, breaks existing partner data cohesion

**Option C: Hybrid Approach with Modular Design** (Selected)
- Pros: Extends existing service while maintaining modular code organization, enables future service splitting if needed
- Cons: Requires careful design to avoid tight coupling

**Rationale:** Option C provides the best balance for Phase 2 goals by extending the proven partner service architecture while maintaining clean separation of concerns. This approach leverages existing multi-company data isolation, event publishing, and API patterns while keeping related partner data cohesive.

## External Dependencies

**No new external dependencies required** - Implementation will use existing technology stack:
- **SQLAlchemy:** For enhanced model relationships and constraints
- **Pydantic:** For API schema validation and serialization
- **FastAPI:** For REST endpoint implementation
- **Redis:** For event publishing using existing messaging patterns
- **Alembic:** For database migration management

**Justification:** Existing dependencies already provide all required functionality for enhanced partner management. The current tech stack has proven effective for partner service implementation in Phase 1.
