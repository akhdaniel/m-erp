# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-05-sales-module/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-05
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Sales Module Architecture
- Implement as plugin-within-service using established extension framework patterns
- Follow Business Object Framework for standardized CRUD operations and audit logging
- Integrate with existing inventory module (port 8005) for real-time stock information
- Leverage existing partner management for customer data and communication tracking
- Use FastAPI for REST API implementation with async support and auto-documentation

### Core Business Entities
- **Quote/Estimate Entity** - Complete quote lifecycle with line items, pricing, and approval status
- **Sales Order Entity** - Converted quotes with inventory reservations and fulfillment tracking  
- **Quote Line Items** - Product references with quantities, pricing, discounts, and availability checks
- **Order Line Items** - Confirmed line items with inventory reservations and delivery tracking
- **Pricing Rules** - Customer-specific pricing, volume discounts, and promotional pricing logic
- **Sales Analytics** - Quote conversion tracking, sales performance metrics, and forecasting data

### Integration Requirements
- **Inventory Module Integration** - Real-time stock queries, inventory reservations, and availability checks
- **Partner Management Integration** - Customer data access, communication history, and relationship tracking
- **Purchasing Module Integration** - Automatic purchase recommendations for low stock items
- **Currency Service Integration** - Multi-currency pricing and conversion for international sales
- **Audit Service Integration** - Complete audit trail for all sales transactions and changes
- **Event Publishing** - Redis Streams events for quote creation, order placement, and status changes

### API Design Patterns
- Follow established patterns from inventory and purchasing modules
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Pydantic schemas for request/response validation and auto-documentation
- Pagination support for list endpoints with filtering and sorting capabilities
- Bulk operations support for quote and order management
- Search functionality across quotes, orders, and customer data

### Performance Requirements  
- Real-time inventory availability checks with sub-second response times
- Concurrent quote processing without inventory reservation conflicts
- Efficient pricing calculations for large quote line item lists
- Optimized database queries for sales analytics and reporting
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed product and pricing data

## Approach Options

**Option A: Separate Sales Service** 
- Pros: Complete isolation, independent scaling, technology flexibility
- Cons: Additional deployment complexity, network overhead, operational burden

**Option B: Plugin-within-Service Extension** (Selected)
- Pros: Leverages existing infrastructure, faster development, consistent patterns
- Cons: Shared technology stack, potential resource competition

**Option C: Extend Existing Services**
- Pros: Minimal new infrastructure, tight integration
- Cons: Service responsibility boundaries blur, harder maintenance

**Rationale:** Option B leverages the proven plugin-within-service architecture successfully used for purchasing and inventory modules, enabling rapid development while maintaining integration benefits and operational simplicity.

## External Dependencies

**No new external libraries required** - leveraging existing technology stack:

- **FastAPI** - Already established for REST API development across modules
- **SQLAlchemy** - Database ORM consistent with existing services  
- **Pydantic** - Request/response validation and serialization
- **Redis** - Event publishing and caching using existing infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** - Database storage using established multi-company patterns

**Integration Dependencies:**
- **Inventory Module APIs** - Stock queries and reservation management
- **Partner Management APIs** - Customer data and communication access
- **Currency Service APIs** - Multi-currency pricing and conversion
- **Business Object Framework** - Standardized CRUD and audit patterns

**Justification:** All dependencies are already part of the established XERPIUM technology stack, ensuring consistency and reducing operational complexity while leveraging proven integration patterns.
